# ipfs-files

This directory holds files downloaded from the PSF IPFS network with the `psffpp-download` command.

If you want to upload files to the IPFS network via the `psffpp-upload` [PSFFPP](https://psffpp.com) command, copy them here first. That command will then add it and return the CID.

Once uploaded, you can pin them the CID to the PSF IPFS network with the `psffpp-pin` command.
